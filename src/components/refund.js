          1.1 No Cash Refunds: Due to the nature of fantasy sports and the
          instantaneous nature of our services, we do not provide cash
          refunds for any transactions, including but not limited to entry
          fees, virtual currency purchases, or other in-app transactions.

          1.2 Virtual Currency: Any virtual currency or in-app purchases
          made on our platform are non-refundable. Virtual currency has no

          intended purposes.
